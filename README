mailp - Mail Ping
=================

mailp is designed to make monitoring SMTP servers simple. It sends an e-mail to
any address you want and watches your local mbox file for its return.

It is currently being developed, is very raw, and really shouldn't be used by
anyone other than developers at the moment.

TODO
----
 - Detect whether to use mutt_dotlock, procmail, or our own (have to write that
   function too).

 - Move e-mail config out of the main script.

 - Payloads (conf.d) for when an e-mail doesn't show up.
